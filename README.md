# Overview
This repository is dedicated to the dissemination of the source code for a pioneering research project on the application of data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the control of DC-DC buck converters feeding Constant Power Loads (CPLs). <br>
This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of applying advanced reinforcement learning techniques directly to power electronics systems. 
Our focus is on developing a controller that can adaptively manage the dynamic environment of DC-DC converters to ensure voltage stability under various operating conditions.
